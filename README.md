2. Drag the **left edge handle** to set the trim start point
3. Drag the **right edge handle** to set the trim end point
4. The original file is not modified ‚Äî only playback range changes

**Split Clips:**
1. Move the playhead (red line) to where you want to split
2. Click the **"Split"** button in the timeline toolbar
3. The clip divides into two separate clips at the playhead position
4. Each clip can now be moved, trimmed, or deleted independently

**Delete Clips:**
1. Click a clip to select it
2. Press **Delete** or **Backspace** key
3. Or click the **"Delete"** button in the toolbar
4. The clip is removed from the timeline (original file remains safe)

- Audio is included from all clips

---

### Advanced Tips

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Spacebar**: Play/Pause
- **Delete/Backspace**: Remove selected clip
- **Click timeline clip**: Select for editing

**Working with Multiple Clips:**
- Arrange clips in sequence to create a montage
- Leave small gaps for "breaths" between scenes
- Use Track 2 for overlays like logos or reactions
- Export clips trimmed from longer recordings for bite-sized content

**Performance Tips:**
- Imported videos stay in their original location (don't move or delete source files)
- Media library persists across app restarts
- Large 4K videos may take longer to export (FFmpeg processing is CPU-intensive)
- Close other heavy applications during export for best performance

**File Management:**
- ClipForge stores thumbnails in: `~/Library/Application Support/ClipForge/thumbnails/` (macOS)
- Media library data saved to: `~/Library/Application Support/ClipForge/` (macOS)
- Original video files are never modified ‚Äî all editing is non-destructive

### How It Works

**1. Main Process (Node.js)**
- Creates the app window using Electron's BrowserWindow
- Handles file system operations (import, save, export)
- Runs FFmpeg commands for video processing
- Manages IPC communication with renderer process

**2. Renderer Process (Browser)**
- Runs the React UI in a sandboxed browser context
- Displays media library, timeline, and video player
- Sends IPC messages to main process for file operations
- Uses Konva canvas for high-performance timeline rendering

**3. Preload Script (Bridge)**
- Safely exposes IPC methods to renderer via `contextBridge`
- Maintains security with `contextIsolation: true`
- Prevents direct Node.js access from browser code

**4. Video Processing Pipeline**
```
Import ‚Üí FFprobe (metadata) ‚Üí Thumbnail generation ‚Üí Media Library
Timeline ‚Üí Export command ‚Üí FFmpeg (encode) ‚Üí MP4 output
```

# Output: out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/
```

**Linux (DEB/RPM):**
```bash
npm run make
# Output: out/make/*.deb and *.rpm
```

### Configuration Files

- **`forge.config.ts`**: Electron Forge packaging settings
  - Configures asar packaging with FFmpeg binary unpacking
  - Sets bundle identifier for macOS (`com.clipforge.app`)
  - Defines makers for DMG, Squirrel, DEB, RPM

- **`webpack.*.config.ts`**: Build configuration for main and renderer
  - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
  - Bundles React and dependencies
  - Configures TailwindCSS processing

- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler settings
  - Strict mode enabled for type safety
  - Path aliases for clean imports

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### App won't start after packaging

**Issue**: Packaged app crashes on launch

**Solution**:
- Ensure FFmpeg binaries are included in `extraResource` (see `forge.config.ts`)
- Check that native modules are unpacked from asar archive
- Run from terminal to see error logs: `./ClipForge.app/Contents/MacOS/ClipForge`

### Videos won't import

**Issue**: Drag-and-drop or import button fails

**Solution**:
- Verify file format is MP4, MOV, or WebM
- Check that FFmpeg binary is accessible (test with `npm start`)
- Ensure file isn't corrupted (try opening in VLC first)

### Export fails or produces corrupt files

**Issue**: Export hangs or output video doesn't play

**Solution**:
- Check available disk space (need ~2x source file size free)
- Verify FFmpeg is working: look for error messages in console
- Try exporting a single clip first to isolate the issue
- Ensure source files haven't been moved or deleted

### Timeline playback is choppy

**Issue**: Video stutters during preview

**Solution**:
- Large 4K files may require more processing power
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- Try zooming in on timeline for smoother rendering
- This is preview only ‚Äî exports will be smooth

### Can't find exported video

**Issue**: Export completes but file isn't where expected

**Solution**:
- Check the path shown in the save dialog
- Default location is usually your user's `Movies` or `Videos` folder
- Search your system for `*.mp4` files created recently
